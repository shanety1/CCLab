<p>I can see you standing, honey</p>
<p>With his arms around your body</p>
<p>Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all</p>
<p>And it took you five whole minutes</p>
<p>To pack us up and leave me with it</p>
<p>Holdin' all this love out here in the hall</p>
<p>I think I've seen this film before</p>
<p>You're not my homeland anymore</p>
<p>You were my town</p>
<p>I think I've seen this film before</p>
<p>Like he's just your understudy</p>
<p>Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me</p>
<p>Second, third, and hundredth chances</p>
<p>Balancin' on breaking branches</p>
<p>Those eyes add insult to injury</p>
<p>I think I've seen this film before</p>
<p>And I didn't like the ending</p>
<p>I'm not your problem anymore</p>
<p>So who am I offending now?</p>
<p>You were my crown</p>
<p>Now I'm in exile, seein' you out</p>
<p>I think I've seen this film before</p>
<p>So I'm leavin' out the side door</p>
<p>So step right out, there is no amount</p>
<p>Of crying I can do for you</p>
<p>All this time</p>
<p>We always walked a very thin line</p>
<p>You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)</p>
<p>You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)</p>
<p>All this time</p>
<p>I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)</p>
<p>I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)</p>
<p>'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)</p>
<p>So many signs, so many signs</p>
<p>You didn't even see the signs</p>
<p>I think I've seen this film before</p>
<p>And I didn't like the ending</p>
<p>You're not my homeland anymore</p>
<p>So what am I defending now?</p>
<p>You were my town</p>
<p>Now I'm in exile, seein' you out</p>
<p>I think I've seen this film before</p>
<p>So I'm leavin' out the side door</p>
<p>So step right out, there is no amount</p>
<p>Of crying I can do for you</p>
<p>All this time</p>
<p>We always walked a very thin line</p>
<p>You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)</p>
<p>You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)</p>
<p>All this time</p>
<p>I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)</p>
<p>I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)</p>
<p>'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)</p>
<p>All this time (So many signs)</p>
<p>I never learned to read your mind (So many signs)</p>
<p>I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)</p>
<p>'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)</p>
<p>You never gave a warning sign</p>
<p>Ah, ah</p>
